		caption: In ancient Egyptian mythology, cats played a very important role. It is said that cats ruled humans a long time ago. 
		caption: They were cunning, cruel and very smart. They drove humans as slaves.
		caption: Until dogs appeared. they drove the cat away and turned the cat from a ruler into a human pet. So the dog was regarded by the Egyptians as the most important friend in life.
		bubble: And the Egyptians believed that cats would bring death. //mom holds tea cup //white house cat appears

Section 2 {
	Page 2{ //telling reprequisite. whole page panel with crossing captions/bubbles
		bubble: Does the Egyptian myth only involve cats? //I asked my mother
		bubble: Of course not. I am telling the story of an oriental cat today. //mom takes a sip

		caption: The myth has it that if a creature collects seven wits in the world, it becomes immortal. //mom
				 cats too, of course - magical cats collect an extra tail every 20 yrs. Once they have 9 tails, they become immortal.
		bubble: but that's not easy. for their 9th tail, they have to grant someone's wish, and wish granting takes away one tail. so its a loop.

		bubble: but this is really just a myth. I heard that cat only helps the decendants of its first owner, and will grant ANY wish. 
		bubble: still, it never got its 9th tail.
